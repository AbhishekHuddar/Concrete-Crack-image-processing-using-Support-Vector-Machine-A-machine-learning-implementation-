# Concrete-Crack-image-processing-using-Support-Vector-Machine-A-machine-learning-implementation-
The project is a Machine Learning implementation. The purpose is to analyze dataset which consists of labelled images of concrete cracks. Here we are using scikit learn python library in order to process these images in rightfully identifying cracks and non cracks in any given dataset. The objective of the project is to find the accuracy with which the given SVM is able to classify images as cracked and non cracked.
The python code was written in jupyter notebook.

The dataset can be downloaded from the below link:
